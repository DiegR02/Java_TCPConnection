# Java_TCPConnection ðŸ”Œ
Simple TCP connection developed with Java.

This project has two java classes, 'Cliente' (From Cliente.java) and 'Servidor' (From Servidor.java). The objective of this program is to create a simple TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with Sockets.

A socket in Java is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.[^1]

First, we will execute Servidor.java file, wich will perform like the server. And second, we will execute Cliente.java file, wich will perform like a client.
